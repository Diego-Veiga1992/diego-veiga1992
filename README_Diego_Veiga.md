# 👋 Hi, I'm Diego Veiga!

I’ve spent several years working in roles such as **Process Manager**, **Logistics Supervisor**, and currently serve as a **Retail Supervisor** in Ireland. My background is in Petroleum Engineering, but I found my true passion in using data to drive meaningful decisions.

Today, I'm focused on **Data Science**, specializing in **Machine Learning** and **predictive modeling**.

---

## 💻 In my projects, I've developed skills in:
- Exploratory Data Analysis & data visualization  
- Predictive modeling (Churn, Segmentation, LTV)  
- Process automation with **Excel + VBA**  
- Machine Learning with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**  
- Data extraction & wrangling using **SQL**, **Pandas**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**

---

## 🛠️ Tools I work with:
`Python` | `SQL` | `Excel + VBA` | `Jupyter` | `Power BI` | `Git/GitHub` | `Scikit-learn` | `Keras` | `nltk` |

---

## 📚 Currently exploring:
- **NLP applied to employee and customer feedback**  
- **Recommendation systems**  
- **Time series analysis & demand forecasting**  
- Model deployment and data portfolio best practices

---

## ✨ Fun fact:
Before becoming a data scientist, I built complete business control systems using Excel + VBA for sales, logistics, and inventory – all without writing a single line of Python!
